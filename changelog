BETA NOTES

* this release should work on both classic and retail
* the following notes only apply to classic:
- there are likely to be some errors which I didn't find,
- various options are still visible for features which don't exist (auras, castbars, ...)
- you'll need to check the option to enable loading out of date addons (because I need to set up packaging correctly)
- thanks <3

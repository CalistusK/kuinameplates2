BETA NOTES
* add option to disable name-only specifically on friends
* add option to disable name-only on damaged enemies
* add separate options to disable name-only on friends or enemies in combat
* fix name-only sticks on some enemies which switch from unattackable to attackable (and issues related to that. #1, #255)
* update hunter, priest, rogue & warrior auto-detected execute range (thanks to timoff32)
* simplify name-only config page
* update name-only config locale

Even more boring things:
* ignore more debug events by default
* make /knp dump's debug frame easier to drag. wow.
* make commands like "/knp > auras" work as shortcuts for the config pages, so my text can be copied and run without adjustment when I say that to people.
* slash commands /knp debug-{frames,ignore} moved to /knp debug {frames,ignore} (no hyphon)
* add slash command /knp debug all for extra chat spam

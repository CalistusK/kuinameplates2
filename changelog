UNTESTED

* hide permanent auras from frames by default (spells included in the KSLC whitelist will still be shown)
* apply KSLC blacklist to purgable auras
* allow creating new profiles with /knp profile! profile name (mostly so I can give people testing macros without affecting their profile)

* add option auras_highlight_other, enabled by default, not exposed in ui
* remove yanone kaffeesatz

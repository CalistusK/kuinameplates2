BETA NOTES

* add options for name text colour - all name text is now coloured by default, and the colour is now consistent with name only mode
* guild text colour now always matches name text (in name only)

* fix death knight, demon hunter and shaman name text class colours ignore ClassColors' configuration

* added CVar config page with options for various hidden nameplate settings in the game (including render distance and clamping)
* disable frFR since it has a lot of overlong titles

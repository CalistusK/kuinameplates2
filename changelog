* aura options "use default ui filter" and "use whitelist" have been removed;
  The default behaviour is now to use the vanilla UI's filter, but
  KuiSpellListConfig can still be used to modify the spells displayed,
  including tracking any auras caused by other players.
* add "whitelist all own auras" and "blacklist all other auras" options

* add slash-command shortcuts - i.e. type /knp auras or /knp a to open
directly to the auras config page (this uses page names from the locale)
* increase default small font size slightly (from 9 to 10)
* increase default castbar height slightly
* brighten default castbar colour slightly
* remove brackets from around player guild text

* add koKR localisation contributed by yuk6196 (thanks!)
* add ruRU localisation contributed by BLizzatron (also thanks!)
* add Roboto Condensed Bold to ruRU clients and use it by default

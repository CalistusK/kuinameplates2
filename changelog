* fix disappearing class powers when on target

* Config UI: slightly redesigned for taller pages
* fix lua error relating to API functions returning non-kui plates
* fix lua error related to missing functions in "DBM"
* fix lua error related to castbars when switching profiles with certain settings
* update locale

* remove a no-longer-necessary update script, improving CPU usage whenever nameplates are visible

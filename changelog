* simplify name-only config page;
* add option to disable name-only specifically on friends,
* add option to disable name-only on damaged enemies,
* add separate options to disable name-only on friends or enemies in combat.
* add option fade_friendly_npc_exclude_titled (not exposed in ui)
* add option castbar_spacing (not exposed in ui)
* update hunter, priest, rogue & warrior auto-detected execute range (thanks to timoff32)
* update locale
* move health & level text slightly
* reduce default target_arrows_inset
* reduce default minus frame height slightly
* alter text offset scaling (only if global_scale is used)
* force text offsets to align to half pixels
* fix text flashing on frames using KuiNameplatesPersonalAnchor (will cause a change in size and position)
* fix name-only sticks on some enemies which switch from unattackable to attackable (and issues related to that)

Even more boring:
* ignore more debug events by default
* make /knp dump's debug frame easier to drag. wow.
* make commands like "/knp > auras" work as shortcuts for the config pages, so my text can be copied and run without adjustment when I say that to people.
* slash commands /knp debug-{frames,ignore} moved to /knp debug {frames,ignore} (no hyphon)
* add slash command /knp debug all for extra chat spam
* do this: `/run KuiNameplatesCoreSaved.SHUT_UP=true` if you use the alpha and you don't want to see the orientation message
* you're the only person reading this.

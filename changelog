* fix text flashing on frames using KuiNameplatesPersonalAnchor (which will result in a size/position difference)
* update locale

* move health & level text slightly
* reduce default target_arrows_inset

* add option fade_friendly_npc_exclude_titled (not exposed in ui)

Even more boring things:
* ignore more debug events by default
* make /knp dump's debug frame easier to drag. wow.
* make commands like "/knp > auras" work as shortcuts for the config pages, so my text can be copied and run without adjustment when I say that to people.
* slash commands /knp debug-{frames,ignore} moved to /knp debug {frames,ignore} (no hyphon)
* add slash command /knp debug all for extra chat spam
* add KuiNameplatesCoreSaved.SHUT_UP to silence the alpha orientation message

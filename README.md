Reporting issues
----------------
Issues submitted [here](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates2/issues) won't necessarily receive a response, but I do read all of them. If you just want to ask a question or get in touch with me, the comments on [Curse](http://mods.curse.com/addons/WoW/kuinameplates) are a better option. I (usually) try to respond to all of those.

When submitting an issue:
- Separate distinct issues into multiple tickets. It's easier to work with that way.
- If you've modified code or are using any third-party nameplate addon or plugin (including Kui_Nameplates_Custom scripts), try to reproduce the issue without it first, and tell me what you're using or what you've changed.
- If relevant, run this in chat: "/knp dump-config" (no quotes). It'll pop up a little window with the textual version of your KNP configuration. Copy that into your report.
- Remember I'm human. Though I do main a Draenei.
